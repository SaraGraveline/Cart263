        Area 51, secret U.S. Air Force military installation located at <span class="redacted">Groom Lake in southern Nevada.</span>
        It is administered by Edwards Air Force Base in southern California. The installation has been
        the focus of numerous conspiracies involving <span class="redacted">extraterrestrial life, though its only confirmed
        use is as a flight testing facility.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        For years there was speculation about the installation, <span class="redacted">especially amid growing reports of UFO
        sightings in the vicinity.</span> The site became known as Area 51, which was its designation on maps
        of the Atomic Energy Commission. Conspiracy theories gained support <span class="redacted">in the late 1980s, when a man
        alleging to have worked at the installation claimed that the government was examining recovered
        alien spacecraft.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2013 the U.S. government officially acknowledged the existence of Area 51. That year the National
        Security Archive at the George Washington University obtained through the <span class="redacted">Freedom of Information Act
        (FOIA) a formerly classified CIA document that chronicled the history of the U-2 spy plane;</span> a heavily
        redacted version had previously been released in 1998. According to the report, in 1955 the remote
        site— <span class="redacted">which included an airfield not used by the military since World War II </span>—was selected in order to
        test the U-2. Test flights of that spy plane, and subsequent aircraft, accounted for <span class="redacted">many of the UFO
        sightings in the area;</span> the U-2 could reach altitudes much higher than any other planes at the time.
        After the U-2 was put into service in 1956, Area 51 was used to develop <span class="redacted">other aircraft, including the
        A-12 (also known as OXCART) reconnaissance plane</span> and the stealth fighter F-117 Nighthawk.
