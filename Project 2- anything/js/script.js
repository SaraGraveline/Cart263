/**
Project 2 - Anything
Sara Graveline

Ideas for this project:
1. A music video where there is a list of songs to pick from and after selecting the lyrics to the song appears and you sing it with your microphone on.
2. A ecapse room inspired by BTS.
3. A website where you create a collage by dragging and dropping stuff.
4. The whole process of graphic design where you talk with the client, design the stuff and print it.
5. escape room with graphic design.
