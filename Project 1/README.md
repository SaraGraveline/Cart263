# Project 1 - A Night at the Movies
Sara Graveline

This project is loosely based on the movie called Nerve. In this movie, the player needs to get the dare given by the watcher.
The dare can be anything and at the end, there is only one player. This project looks at two made up dare that the user needs to preform to finish the game.
Dare 1 is to drop a worse picture of oneself and dare 2 is to name the family member one dislike the most.
