#Reality Check - Project 2
by Sara Graveline


My second project will be a game called, Reality Check because it will test the userâ€™s
knowledge and abilities on different topics through different types of quizzes. The quizzes are based on Friends the show, finding Nemo, and a revealing a note written for teacher and TA. This game idea is so open that one could create endless numbers of quizzes for any audience but because I need a lot of time to program, I will have about four quizzes in total. My main goal is to apply the techniques I learned in this class to this game and make it a fun game. I plan to create a minimalist UI design with fun colours to create a clean and exciting look. It will be one player quiz game. Instead of having different buttons linking different quizzes, I will
have a different quiz appear when the page is loaded. Right now, this game seems easy and simple because I am a slow learner, but I hope it is fun. Right now, I still do not fully understand all the libraries but I am hoping to learn it this summer. I am sorry that I could not put a lot of time in this project. This is because I needed to do everything to pass my accounting class since I failed the mid-term and I do not have background in math.
